![](www/mixall.png)

- This folder contains the tutorials for learning mixed models and how to extract BLUEs and BLUPs. 
- This tutorial demonstrates how to extract BLUES and BLUPs without using any software or package. 
- This is to show you the main engine behind the philosophy of BLUEs and BLUPS by just solving the Mixed Model Equation give by Henderson (1950)

***No more tricks, no secrets, just good old matrix multiplication***
